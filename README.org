** Basic Usage 
1. Start a blog using [[https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html][Pelican]]
2. Clone this repository alongside your ~pelicanconf.py~
3. Add THEME = "./astrochelys" to ~pelicanconf.py~
4. Add [[https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-toc][pelican-toc]] to your PLUGINS. This can be customized as described [[https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-toc#settings][here]].

** Customizations
*** Analytics
Astrochelys supports both [[https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/][Google]] and [[https://usefathom.com/][Fathom]] analytics. 
- To use Google Analytics, set the ~GOOGLE_ANALYTICS~ variable in ~pelicanconf.py~ to your Analytics ID.
- To use Fathom, set the ~FATHOM_SITE_ID~ variable to the site ID given by Fathom, and the ~FATHOM_ANALYTICS~ variable to the server address performing the tracking (We use [[https://github.com/usefathom/fathom][Fathom Lite]] hosted on [[https://www.heroku.com/][Heroku]] for this, following the instructions [[https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/blob/master/docs/misc/Heroku.md#create-the-app][here]].)

*** Comments
Astrochelys provides comments using either [[https://hypothes.is/][Hypothesis]] or [[https://disqus.com/][Disqus]] (or both). Disqus support is controlled by the variable ~DISQUS_SITENAME~ in ~pelicanconf.py~. Hypothesis is embedded in the header and appears on the right side of the page.

*** Colors & Fonts
- All website colors and fonts are defined in the first few lines of ~static/css/astrochelys.css~, change these for a different theme. 
- Syntax highlighting colors are defined in ~static/css/pygments.css~. Change this to any pygments theme you like.

*** Margin notes
See [[https://out-of-cheese-error.netlify.app/astrochelys#org6d6ec31][here]] on how to add margin notes to your articles.
