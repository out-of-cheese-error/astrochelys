* The Astrochelys Pelican Theme
This is the theme we use for [[https://out-of-cheese-error.netlify.app/][OutOfCheeseError]]
** Basic Usage 
1. Start a blog using [[https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html][Pelican]]
2. Clone this repository alongside your ~pelicanconf.py~
3. *Add the following options* to ~pelicanconf.py~. (the table of contents can be customized as desribed [[https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-toc#settings][here]])
#+BEGIN_SRC python
THEME = "./astrochelys"
TAG_SAVE_AS = ''
AUTHOR_SAVE_AS = ''
CATEGORY_SAVE_AS = ''
PLUGINS = ['pelican-toc']
DIRECT_TEMPLATES = (('index', 'tags', 'categories', 'archives'))
#+END_SRC


** Customizations
*** Margin notes and Side notes
Add margin and side notes to your articles by including raw HTML (which can be done in markdown, Jupyter notebook, and org-mode formats at least)

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<label for="mn-note" class="margin-toggle">&raquo;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-note" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
your note here
</span>
#+END_SRC

and for a numbered side-note:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<label for="sn-note" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-note" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
your note here
</span>
#+END_SRC

*Change mn-note and sn-note to different names for each additional note* (both in the label and the id)

*** Analytics
Astrochelys supports both [[https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/][Google]] and [[https://usefathom.com/][Fathom]] analytics. 
- To use Google Analytics, set the ~GOOGLE_ANALYTICS~ variable in ~pelicanconf.py~ to your Analytics ID.
- To use Fathom, set the ~FATHOM_SITE_ID~ variable to the site ID given by Fathom, and the ~FATHOM_ANALYTICS~ variable to the server address performing the tracking (We use [[https://github.com/usefathom/fathom][Fathom Lite]] hosted on [[https://www.heroku.com/][Heroku]] for this, following the instructions [[https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/blob/master/docs/misc/Heroku.md#create-the-app][here]].)

*** Comments
Astrochelys provides comments using either [[https://hypothes.is/][Hypothesis]] or [[https://disqus.com/][Disqus]] (or both). Disqus support is controlled by the variable ~DISQUS_SITENAME~ in ~pelicanconf.py~. Hypothesis is embedded in the header and appears on the right side of the page.

*** Search
Astrochelys supports search via [[https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch][tinysearch]] and some JS code taken from [[https://github.com/mre/mre.github.io][Matthias Endler's blog source]]. To set this up:
+ Install tinysearch and terser as described in the tinysearch repository 
+ Add a ~json.md~ file in ~your_pelican_directory/content/pages~ with
#+BEGIN_SRC md
Title: JSON
Template: json
Slug: json
#+END_SRC
+ Set the ~ADD_SEARCH_BOX~ variable to ~True~ in ~pelicanconf.py~ 
+ Finally, add the following to your pelican ~Makefile~:
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  .PHONY: index
  index: content ## Build the search index with tinysearch
          tinysearch --optimize --path $(OUTPUTDIR) $(OUTPUTDIR)/pages/json.html
  .PHONY: minify
  minify: ## Compress JavaScript assets
          terser --compress --mangle --output $(OUTPUTDIR)/search_min.js -- $(OUTPUTDIR)/tinysearch_engine.js

  .PHONY: build
  build: html index minify ## Build static site and search index, minify JS
#+END_SRC
and, instead of running ~pelican content~ to build your output files, run ~make build~ instead.

*** Colors & Fonts
- All website colors and fonts are defined in the first few lines of ~static/css/astrochelys.css~, change these for a different theme. The modified fonts need to be downloaded from Google Fonts in the Fonts section of the ~<head>~ in ~static/templates/base.html~ 
- Syntax highlighting colors are defined in ~static/css/pygments.css~. Change this to any pygments theme you like.
